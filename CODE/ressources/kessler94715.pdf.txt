The work presented\nin this paper has been carried out in one industrial project\n(VOCAGEN) aiming at automating the production of struc-\ntured data from human machine dialogues. Speciﬁcally, the\ntargeted application drives dialogues with people working in\na construction area for populating a database reporting key\ndata extracted from those dialogues. This application requires\ncomplex processing for both transcripting speeches but also for\ndriving dialogues. The ﬁrst process is required for good speech\nrecognition in a noisy environment. The second processing is\nrequired because the database needs to be populated with both\nright and complete data; indeed, people tend to apply a broad\n(colloquial) vocabulary and the transcripted words need to be\nused for ﬁlling in the corresponding data. Additionally, if some\ndata populate the database, additional data may be required\nfor completeness, thus the dialogue should enable to get those\nadditional data (e.g. if the word ”room” is recognised and used\nto populate the database, the location of the room must also\nbe got; this can be done by driving the dialogue).\nThe application provides people with “hand-free” device,\nenabling a complete, quick and standardized reporting. First\nusages of this application will be oriented to reporting failures\nand problems in constructions.\nThe two processing steps mentioned above require on the\none side a “language model” (for transcripting the sentences)\nand on the other side a “knowledge model” for driving the\n', 7, 0)
