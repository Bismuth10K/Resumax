As opposed to the two dominant\ntechniques of computing statistics or writing specialized grammars, our document-centered ap-\nproach works by considering suggestive local contexts and repetitions of individual words within\na document. This approach proved to be robust to domain shifts and new lexica and produced per-\nformance on the level with the highest reported results. When incorporated into a part-of-speech\ntagger, it helped reduce the error rate signiﬁcantly on capitalized words and sentence boundaries.\nWe also investigated the portability to other languages and obtained encouraging results.\n', 4, 0)

These tasks are usually performed before actual “intelligent”\ntext processing starts, and errors made at this stage are very likely to cause more errors\nat later stages and are therefore very dangerous.\nDisambiguation of capitalized words in mixed-case texts has received little atten-\ntion in the natural language processing and information retrieval communities, but in\nfact it plays an important role in many tasks. In mixed-case texts capitalized words\nusually denote proper names (names of organizations, locations, people, artifacts, etc.),\nbut there are special positions in the text where capitalization is expected. Such manda-\ntory positions include the ﬁrst word in a sentence, words in titles with all signiﬁcant\nwords capitalized or table entries, a capitalized word after a colon or open quote, and\nthe ﬁrst word in a list entry, among others. Capitalized words in these and some other\npositions present a case of ambiguity: they can stand for proper names, as in White\nlater said . . . , or they can be just capitalized common words, as in White elephants are\n. . . . The disambiguation of capitalized words in ambiguous positions leads to the\nidentiﬁcation of proper names (or their derivatives), and in this article we will use\nthese two terms and the term case normalization interchangeably.\nChurch (1995, p. 294) studied, among other simple text normalization techniques,\nthe effect of case normalization for different words and showed that “sometimes case\nvariants refer to the same thing (hurricane and Hurricane), sometimes they refer to\ndifferent things (continental and Continental) and sometimes they don’t refer to much\nof anything (e.g., anytime and Anytime).” Obviously these differences arise because\nsome capitalized words stand for proper names (such as Continental, the name of an\nairline) and some do not.\n', 6, 0)
