As part of the METICS project, a suicide prevention\nassociation developed an application of web chat to meet\nthis need. The web chat is an area that allows anyone to\nexpress and share with a volunteer listener their concerns and\nanguishes. The main speciﬁcity of this device is its anonymous\nnature. Protected by a pseudonym, the writers are invited\nto discuss with a volunteer the problematic aspects of their\nexistence. Several thousand anonymous conversations have\nbeen gathered and form a corpus of unpublished stories about\nhuman distress. The purpose of the METICS project is to make\nvisible the ordinary forms of suffering usually removed from\ncommon spaces and to grasp both its modes of enunciation and\ndigital support. In this study, we want to automatically identify\nthe reason for coming on the web chat for each participant.\nIndeed, even if the association provided us with the theme\nof all the conversations (work, loneliness, violence, racism,\naddictions, family, etc.), the original reason has not been\npreserved.

This method does not need to have a tagged\ndata set to predict the different classes, so it is closer to an\nunsupervised (clustering) or semi-supervised learning method\nthan a supervised. The main idea of clustering is to group\nuntagged data into a number of clusters, such that similar ex-\namples are grouped together and different ones are separated.\nIn clustering, the number of classes and the distribution of\ninstances between classes are unknown and the goal is to ﬁnd\nmeaningful clusters.\nOne kind of clustering methods is the partitioning-based\none. The k-means algorithm [3] is one of the most popu-\nlar partitioning-based algorithms because it provides a good\ncompromise between the quality of the solution obtained and\nits computational complexity [4]. K-means aims to ﬁnd k\ncentroids, one for each cluster, minimizing the sum of the\ndistances of each instance of data from its respective centroid.\nWe can cite other partitioning-based algorithms such as k-\nmedoids or PAM (Partition Around Medoids), which is an\nevolution of k-means [5]. Hierarchical approaches produce\nclusters by recursively partitioning data backwards or upwards.\nFor example, in a hierarchical ascending classiﬁcation or\nCAH [6], each example from the initial dataset represents a\ncluster. Then, the clusters are merged, according to a similarity\nmeasure, until the desired tree structure is obtained. The result\nof this clustering method is called a dendrogram. Density-\nbased methods like the EM algorithm [7] assume that the data\nbelonging to each cluster is derived from a speciﬁc probability\n', 10, 0)
