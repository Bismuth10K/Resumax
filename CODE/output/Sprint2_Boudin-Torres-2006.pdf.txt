Titre : A Scalable MMR Approach to Sentence Scoring for Multi-Document Update Summarization

Auteurs : Florian Boudin ; Marc El-Beze ; Juan-Manuel Torres-Moreno

Abstract : We present SMMR, a scalable sentence scoring method for query-oriented update summarization. Sentences are scored thanks to a criterion combining query relevance and dissimilarity with already read documents (history). As the amount of data in history increases, non-redundancy is prioritized over query-relevance. We show that SMMR achieves promising results on the DUC 2007 update corpus.
