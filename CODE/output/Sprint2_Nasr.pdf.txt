MACAON is a tool suite for standard NLP tasks developed for French. MACAON has been de- signed to process both human-produced text and highly ambiguous word-lattices produced by NLP tools. MACAON is made of several na- tive modules for common tasks such as a tok- enization, a part-of-speech tagging or syntac- tic parsing, all communicating with each other through XML ﬁles . In addition, exchange pro- tocols with external tools are easily deﬁnable. MACAON is a fast, modular and open tool, dis- tributed under GNU Public License.
